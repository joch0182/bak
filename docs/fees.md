### Notebooks

- [Deep Learning with Torch - A 60-minute blitz](https://github.com/soumith/cvpr2015/blob/master/Deep Learning with Torch.ipynb)
- [NNGraph - graph style neural networks](https://github.com/soumith/cvpr2015/blob/master/NNGraph Tutorial.ipynb)
- [Character-level Recurrent networks. An introduction to real-world nngraph RNN training](https://github.com/soumith/cvpr2015/blob/master/Char-RNN.ipynb). Original code by @karpathy
- [Deep-Q Reinforcement learning to play Atari games](https://github.com/soumith/cvpr2015/blob/master/DQN Training iTorch.ipynb)

### Video Tutorials
* [An introduction to Torch. Implementing Convolution Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks by Nicholas Leonard](http://on-demand.gputechconf.com/gtc/2015/webinar/torch7-applied-deep-learning-for-vision-natural-language.mp4)
* [Torch Video Tutorials](https://github.com/Atcold/torch-Video-Tutorials). Covers the basics (*Lua*, *Torch*'s `Tensor` and `image` package) and intruduces the concepts of neural networks, forward and backward propagation (both by-hand using `Tensor`s and with the `nn` package). More topics will be added soon.
